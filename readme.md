# Overview:
Will need to reset account in Dev environment and double check api keys after every 3rd Saturday of the month. To do this reach out to Andy Chavez via Teams to reset account. Sometimes he forgets, but make sure you have set up as a Admin otherwise API calls will not work. 

This card displays courses and grades for a user in a single row. Currently as of (9-19-23) the API call is hardcoded for testing purposes. 

You can find the code for the card in the src directory and the code the AWS Lambda function is located in the canvas-api-handler directory.

# Additional Notes: 
Disregard i18n and utils directories. These were created for testing purposes. They are not incorporated into the final card in production.
